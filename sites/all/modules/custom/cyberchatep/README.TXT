==========

This module integrates Cyberhus' custom chat, developed by WWI, into Drupal
 
 It does the following
 - makes a block with the chat entry point, that can be placed in the desired region
 - makes an AJAX call to the backend to check if the status of the chat has changed 
 - displays the status of the chat and includes nice jquery slide functionality with a login form or video content while the chat is occupied or closed
 - an administration page where the opening hours and welcome messages can be set

Remember
- to go to the permissions page and activate the desired settings accessing admin pages and the chat entry point itself
